> **Abstract:** Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show promising potential in automating this process, reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert preferences. Conventional task-agnostic automatic evaluation metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems—primarily designed for mainstream NLP tasks—are insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards. To address this gap and support realistic human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences. Instead of assigning a single overall score, our framework decomposes the evaluation into smaller fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can theoretically facilitate better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight LLMs.  Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and bears a strong correlation with the assessment of human experts. We also observe that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve based on feedback as well.

## Project Summary

We propose a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates classical related work evaluation criteria with expert specific preferences. The project consists of two stages. We first select the evaluator models via preliminary evaluation experiments with contrastive few-shot examples. Then, we run our pipeline which employs an iterative algorithm where generation and evaluation are interleaved, simulating multi-turn human-AI interaction.

## Installation

```
conda create -n grep python=3.11
conda activate grep
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

We introduce a novel dataset for automatic related work generation. Specifically, the dataset includes content from the main papers' related work sections, as well as content from the papers cited within those sections. For each main paper, the dataset provides detailed metadata, along with both raw and cleaned versions of the abstract, introduction, and related work sections. For each cited paper, the dataset includes the abstract and introduction as they appear under the corresponding related work section. You can access the dataset by following this [link](https://tudatalib.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/handle/tudatalib/4700).

## Preliminary Evaluation Experiments

In this step, we create a mini-benchmark to determine performance of the LLMs in evaluating coherence of citation sentences and the positioning of the main paper in related work. Based on this mini-benchmark candidate evaluation models are compared.

```
python generate_eval_instances.py --env_file api.env --dataset_file "path_to_dataset" --output_path "your_output_path"
```

Parameter explanation:

* ```env_file```
  * Environment file to set necessary API keys, please change `api.env` with your own specific API keys. In our experiments, we utilize Azure framework, you can directly use OpenAI service by making necessary small adjustments in `models.py`.

* ```deployment_name```
  * Model name to generate synthetic instances. Default model name is `gpt-4o`.

* ```api_version```
  * API version. Default value is `2025-03-01-preview`.

* ```prompt_file```
  * Path to the file of preliminary evaluation prompts. Default value is `eval_exp_prompts.json`.

* ```dataset_file```
  * Path to the main dataset file `final_rw_data.json`.

* ```output_path```
  * Path where generated data will be saved. Three files will be generated, namely `coherence_data.json`, `contribution_type_data.json`, `contribution_check_data.json`.

* ```target_number```
  * Number of desired instances for mini-benchmark for each evaluation dimension. Default values is `50`.

After having evaluation data is ready. You can run:
